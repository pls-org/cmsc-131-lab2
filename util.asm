; util.asm - gcd_asm and sum_range_asm, both recursive, callable from C.
;
; This is your starting point: it assembles and links as-is, so the build
; works before you write any code. Right now gcd_asm returns 0 and
; sum_range_asm returns 0, so the benchmark's --gcd and --reentrancy demos
; fail. Your job is to replace both.
;
; The contracts, from bench.c:
;
;       int b                       [ebp+12]
;       int a                       [ebp+8]
;       int gcd_asm(int a, int b)   returns the greatest common divisor
;
;       int hi                      [ebp+12]
;       int lo                      [ebp+8]
;       int sum_range_asm(lo, hi)   returns the sum of lo..hi inclusive
;
; Both are C-facing and must obey cdecl: prologue, args at [ebp+8]+, return
; in eax, preserve ebx/esi/edi/ebp, clean arguments after every call.
;
; gcd_asm also sets the global `gcd_depth` to the recursion depth of its
; most recent call. The depth is the number of gcd calls on the stack at
; the deepest point, the first call counted as 1. gcd(1071, 462) makes
; four calls, so it reaches 4. bench.c declares the global extern and
; prints it after --gcd:
;
;       int gcd_depth               (in .bss, exported, one int)
;
; The manual's requirements:
;
;   * Both recursive (Euclid's algorithm for gcd).
;   * sum_range_asm must be reentrant. It has to stay correct when a second
;     call begins before the first has finished. That means no .data or
;     .bss storage that changes during execution. Everything lives on the
;     stack and in registers. The static gcd_depth global is gcd's, not
;     sum_range's, and it is diagnostic rather than part of a result.
;   * sum_range_asm calls the C function bench_callback(void) once each
;     time C calls it, which is how bench makes one call overlap another.
;     The recursive calls must not call it again. bench counts the calls.
;     Declare it extern and call it with cdecl. It is not in the manual's
;     pseudocode, but it is what the reentrancy demo runs on.
;   * No calls into the C standard library.
;
; Euclid:
;
;   gcd(a, b):
;       if b == 0: return a
;       return gcd(b, a % b)
;
; sum_range, written so that nothing lives outside the stack:
;
;   sum_range(lo, hi):
;       if lo > hi: return 0
;       return lo + sum_range(lo + 1, hi)
;

; Windows C puts a leading underscore on every exported name. Linux C does
; not. The Makefile passes -d ELF_TYPE on Linux. This block then respells
; the names below to match. asm_io.inc does the same for _asm_main in the
; bootcamp blocks. Leave this block alone.
